# GRC Engineering • AWS Edition

**Not your mama’s checkbox GRC.** This repo is a living, practical toolkit for running governance, risk, and compliance like an engineering function in an AWS cloud environment. Think: **controls-as-code, evidence-as-data, and low-friction workflows** that partner with DevOps instead of blocking them.

## What’s inside
- **Controls Catalog & Mappings**: Opinionated baseline mapped to NIST 800-53 Rev5, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 TSC. With AWS-native services and example guardrails.
- **Evidence Playbooks (AWS)**: Step-by-step guides + CLI snippets to pull repeatable, timestamped evidence for audits.
- **Policies & Procedures**: Plain-language policies plus procedures you can actually follow.
- **Runbooks & Tabletops**: Quick drills for incident, backup/restore, and vendor risk scenarios.
- **Automation Hooks**: Starters for turning manual checks into pipeline-friendly scripts.

> Tone & intent: **practical, reusable, and AWS-first**.
