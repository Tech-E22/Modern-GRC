PRs welcome. Keep it pragmatic:
- Prefer **repeatable** steps over screenshots.
- If you add evidence steps, include:
  - a CLI/API example
  - expected output shape
  - redaction guidance
- Map controls to **at least one** framework (NIST/ISO/SOC 2) and one AWS service.
- Keep policy language **plain**; move details into procedures.
